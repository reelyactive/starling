An emulator of wireless device transmissions in the IoT
-------------------------------------------------------

starling is an emulator of decoded wireless device transmissions.  It provides a friendly web interface for preparing and running an emulation sequence in order to validate a scenario or to test our software stack.

__In the scheme of Things (pun intended)__

starling emulates decoded wireless device transmissions as they are consumed by [barnacles](https://www.npmjs.com/package/barnacles) (and soon [barnowl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/barnowl) too).  starling may be used in place of reelyActive hardware.  Check out our [developer page](http://reelyactive.github.io/) for more resources on reelyActive software and hardware.

What's in a name?
-----------------

As [Wikipedia explains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starling#Mimicry), "Starlings imitate a variety of avian species and have a repertoire of about 15â€“20 distinct imitations."  Not only are they natural emulators, they're also occasional food for Barn Owls.  Well how about that for a coincidence.


Installation
------------

    npm install starling


Hello starling
--------------

```javascript
var starling = require('starling');
var emulator = new starling();
```

Then browse to [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003) to see the landing page which provides two means of emulation.


starling and barnacles
----------------------

starling can replace [barnowl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/barnowl) as a source of visibilityEvents for [barnacles](https://www.npmjs.com/package/barnacles).  Simply bind barnacles to the instance of starling as follows:

```javascript
notifications.bind({ barnowl: emulator });
```


Options
-------

The following options are supported when instantiating starling (those shown are the defaults):

    {
      httpPort: 3003
    }


What's next?
------------

This is an active work in progress.  Expect regular changes and updates, as well as improved documentation!
