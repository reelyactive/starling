starling.js
===========

__starling.js__ emulates [hyperlocal context](https://www.reelyactive.com/context/).

__starling.js__ is lightweight client-side JavaScript that runs in the browser.  See a live demo using the code in this repository at: [reelyactive.github.io/starling](https://reelyactive.github.io/starling)


Hello starling.js!
------------------

Include in an _index.html_ file the __starling.js__ script:

```html
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <script src="js/starling.js"></script>
    <script src="js/app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Include in a _js/app.js_ the code to query the emulated hyperlocal context:

```javascript
let context = starling.getContext('/context');
```

Open the _index.html_ file in a web browser for __starling.js__ to emulate the hyperlocal context graph.

What's in a name?
-----------------

As [Wikipedia explains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starling#Mimicry), "Starlings imitate a variety of avian species and have a repertoire of about 15â€“20 distinct imitations." Actually, they can mimic plenty besides other avian species. There are some great videos of starlings mimicking telephones, classical music and more. "Calls that are simple in frequency structure and calls that show little amplitude modulation are preferentially imitated". That's fitting given that the wireless devices currently supported by reelyActive hardware all communicate using [Frequency-Shift Keying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying) (FSK) which involves no amplitude modulation.

Not only are starlings natural emulators, they're also occasional food for Barn Owls. Well how about that for a coincidence.
