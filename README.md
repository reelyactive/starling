Emulator of wireless device transmissions in the IoT
----------------------------------------------------

__starling__ is an emulator of decoded wireless device transmissions, providing a stream of [raddec](https://github.com/reelyactive/raddec) objects.


Installation
------------

    npm install starling


Hello starling!
---------------

```javascript
const Starling = require('starling');

let emulator = new Starling();

emulator.emulate({}, function(emulations) {
  console.log(emulations);
});

emulator.on('raddec', function(raddec) {
  console.log(raddec);
});
```

What's in a name?
-----------------

As [Wikipedia explains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starling#Mimicry), "Starlings imitate a variety of avian species and have a repertoire of about 15â€“20 distinct imitations."  Actually, they can mimic plenty besides other avian species.  There are some great videos of starlings mimicking telephones, classical music and more.  "Calls that are simple in frequency structure and calls that show little amplitude modulation are preferentially imitated".  That's fitting given that the wireless devices currently supported by reelyActive hardware all communicate using [Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying) which involves no amplitude modulation.

Not only are starlings natural emulators, they're also occasional food for Barn Owls.  Well how about that for a coincidence.


What's next?
------------

__starling__ v1.0.0 was released in November 2019, superseding all earlier versions, the latest of which remains available in the [release-0.1 branch](https://github.com/reelyactive/starling/tree/release-0.1) and as [starling@0.1.0 on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/starling/v/0.1.0).
